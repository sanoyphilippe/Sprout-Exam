# Improvements, Technical Debt

### Front-end Improvements/Issues
Currently the front-end only has the Login, Delete Employee, and Get List of Employees feature. There are several things to still finish
for the front-end side as it has not been finished. The base scaffolding and folder structure are all completely done and setup thanks to the usage of Quasar Framework.

### Back-end
Back-end is fully functional and all APIs should be working correctly to Add, Update, Delete employees as well as get specific employee and get all employees list.
